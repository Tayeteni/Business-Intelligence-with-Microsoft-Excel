# Beyond the Skill: Why Business Management Matters
We all know the importance of learning a skill, but what about the crucial element of managing your business?  It's easy to get caught up in mastering the craft, but without proper management, you might find yourself struggling to keep afloat. 

Imagine this: You've spent months learning a valuable skill, you're excited to launch your business, and you're ready to take on clients. But have you stopped to think about how you'll track your income and expenses? How will you manage your customer accounts? How will you know if you're actually making a profit? 

Many focus on teaching skills without equipping learners with the tools and knowledge needed for effective business management. This can leave entrepreneurs feeling lost and overwhelmed, unsure of how to navigate the financial side of their ventures. 

Don't let this happen to you!  It's essential to invest in learning how to manage your business, whether through dedicated software, simple bookkeeping methods, or even just a well-structured notebook. By understanding your numbers, you gain control over your finances, making informed decisions about pricing, expenses, and overall profitability. 

Remember, business management isn't just about keeping track of money â€“ it's about making sure your business is sustainable and thriving, As we've discussed, handling the financial aspect of your business is crucial for its success and sustainability. To emphasize this importance, I'd like to share the different sheets and the functionalities.

## Sheet Breakdown & Purpose

### 1. Inventory Sheet
The Inventory Sheet is designed to help you track and manage your products' stock levels, costs, and sales. This sheet provides a comprehensive overview of your inventory, enabling you to:

- Record product details: ID, category, description, cost price, and selling price
- Monitor initial and remaining quantities
- Automatically update remaining quantities when sales are recorded in other sheets
- Determine restocking needs based on the status column, which indicates:

    - When to restock
    - When urgent restocking is required
    - When restocking is not necessary

Example: If you purchased 10 ceramic lamps and sold 1, the Inventory Sheet will automatically update the remaining quantity to 9.


### 2. Expense Report Sheet

Tracks and records business expenses, including date, item, category, quantity, unit price, total cost, supplier, and notes. Also includes a status column to mark expenses as 'cleared' or 'uncleared', indicating whether they've been deducted from sales revenue to calculate gross profit.

Why is Gross Profit Important?
Gross profit is a key metric for businesses because
it:
*   Helps you understand the profitability of your products or services
*   Informs pricing decisions and product development strategies
*   Provides insight into the efficiency of your operations and supply chain
By tracking gross profit regularly, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your business operations, improve profitability, and drive growth.

Gross profit represents the profit earned from sales after deducting the direct costs associated with producing or purchasing the products sold. In other words, it's the revenue generated from sales minus the cost of goods sold (COGS).
Calculating Gross Profit:
To calculate gross profit, you need to:
1.    Calculate the total revenue from sales
2.    Calculate the total cost of goods sold (COGS), which includes expenses like inventory costs, shipping, and other direct expenses
3.    Subtract the COGS from the total revenue to get the gross profit
Example:
Let's say your business sold products worth $10,000 in a month. The cost of goods sold (COGS) for those products was $6,000.
Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS
= $10,000 - $6,000
= $4,000
This means your business earned a gross profit of $4,000 for that month.


### 3. Sales/Orders Sheet
Sales/Orders Sheet:

This sheet tracks customer orders, automatically updating inventory levels and customer information. Key features:

- Order ID (primary key)
- Product ID (foreign key linking to Inventory Sheet)
- Customer ID (linking to Customer Sheet)
- Category and product description (auto-filled from Inventory Sheet)
- Product price, cost price, and selling price (auto-filled from Inventory Sheet)
- Quantity, overhead, extra charges, client deposit, and total cost
- Revenue made (automatically calculated)
- Status (cleared or uncleared, indicating whether expenses have been accounted for)

This sheet enables accurate tracking of sales, customer information, and inventory levels, while also facilitating expense management and gross profit calculation.

Here's an example:

Let's say a customer walks into your store and purchases a ceramic lamp. To record this sale, you would enter the Product ID, "pro01", into the Sales/Orders Sheet.

As soon as you enter the Product ID, the sheet automatically fills in the category ("Home Decor") and product description ("Ceramic Table Lamp") , cost price,selling price , from the Inventory Sheet. You then enter the quantity sold (1), the overhead costs ($5), and the client deposit ($50).

Once you enter the quantity sold and update the inventory list , the quantity left is updated automatically.

The sheet calculates the total cost ($75) and revenue made ($50). The status is initially marked as "uncleared", indicating that the expense has not yet been accounted for.

Once the expense is recorded in the Expense Report Sheet and marked as "cleared", the status in the Sales/Orders Sheet will also update to "cleared", indicating that the gross profit has been calculated.


### 4. Financial Activity Log Sheet
This sheet provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial activities, enabling stakeholders and CEOs to easily track income, expenses, and revenue. Key features:

- Automatically updates total client deposits, revenue, and expenses
- Displays revenue and expenses as "cleared" or "uncleared", indicating whether calculations are up-to-date
- Calculates gross profit based on cleared revenue and expenses
- Serves as a dashboard for monitoring financial performance and ensuring timely calculations

This sheet helps CEOs and stakeholders:

- Verify that expenses and revenue are being properly accounted for
- Ensure that calculations are completed by the end of each month
- Easily track gross profit and tithe payments
- Maintain accurate financial records and make informed decisions.

### 5. Tithe Sheet
This sheet records and tracks tithe payments made from the company's gross profit. Key features:

- Date of tithe payment
- Amount of tithe paid
- Gross profit from which tithe was paid
- Charge paid (if applicable)
- Account details for payment

The Tithe Sheet enables:

- Easy tracking of tithe payments made each month
- Quick reference for gross profit earned and tithe paid

Example:

"For the month of April, the following tithe was paid:

This sheet provides a clear record of tithe payments and associated gross profit, facilitating easy tracking and reference.
